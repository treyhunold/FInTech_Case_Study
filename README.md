# Case Study
## PitchBook



### Overview and Origin


Pitchbook is a SaaS that provide financial and market data to various investment companies looking to find more data on specific companies and deals they are research. They also provide daily industry news and analytics.

 Pitchbook started in 2007 when, the founder, John Gabbert wanted to pursue an idea from is former employer nixed which was a database that only provided insight on private equity companies. Previously, John had ben building products for the private capital markets industry for nine years. He wanted to “build a product that would meet the needs of professionals” operating in this industry. His main goal was to build more comprehensive data for PE, VC and M&A companies. 

Since the company was founded they have gone through 2 rounds of funding. In 2009, they had a Series A funding round that closed with $4.25 million worth of funding. The latest funding was raised in 2016 from a Series B round which brought in $13.8 million. Morningstar purchased a 20% equity stake and valued the company at $160 million at the time. Later in 2016, MorningStar purchased the remaining ownership for $180 million putting PitchBooks valuation at $225 million. 


### Business Activities:


Pitchbooks main solution is to provide the lack of information available for the private markets. Publicly traded companies have an abundance of information available for companies and individuals to access such as daily stock prices, 10K’s, and other public financial disclosures that do not exist for private companies. Pitchbooks “mission is to provide high-quality information and hard-to-find details on the private capital markests, including valuations, cap table information and deal terms, in addition to the most detailed information on private company financings that no one else has” as stated by the founder himself. (6)

Who is the company’s intended customer? Pitchbook main client base is Private equity firms, Venture Capitalists and Investment Banks dealing with Mergers and Acquisitions. These companies are provided with detailed information on Small and Medium size private business as well as large enterprises. 

Pitchbook utilizes its competitive advantage with a database of more than 1.3 million companies. Using this “the firm can quickly discover businesses within its target regions and industry verticals, as well as see funding history, current investors and similar companies.” (1.4)

Known for its natural language processing and machine learning capabilities, Pitchbook is a the forefront of the FinTech industry. Currently, “PitchBook is releasing fulltime analyst coverage on five sectors including mobility, fintech, foodtech, AI/ML and enterprise blockchain solutions. In the coming weeks, new coverage areas will be released, covering supply chain and logistics technology, consumer IoT, cloud technology, cybersecurity and healthtech – other coverage areas will be added as the private markets continue to expand. PitchBook’s Emerging Technology Research is intended to replace and supplement the challenging research workflows clients face today. The new research product employs a consistent, investor-focused framework to evaluate sectors, providing sector and sub-segment market size estimates, detailed industry outlooks, opportunity and risk assessments, value chain analysis and more. PitchBook clients can access emerging technology research in the Platform’s Research Center.” (1)


### Landscape:


What domain of the finance industry is the company in? Pitchbook is a business intelligence software providing Finance and Market data solutions for small and medium size businesses as well as large enterprises within the private equity, venture capital and M&A. They are the premier data provider for the private and public equity markets. 

Major Trends within this doman: 

“An ecosystem has emerged around low-cost retail tools as inexpensive and tax-efficient ETFs have enabled a new generation of roboadvisors expanding financial advice beyond the mass affluent and middle class.
The availability of alternative data has allowed hedge fund managers to reinvent themselves as “quantamental”, incorporating new machine learning tools into fundamental human analysis as the industry faces scrutiny over high fees and underperformance.
A second wave of personal savings and investment tools have begun to further democratize access to financial services to previously underserved segments.” (1.5)

### Recommendations


Pitchbooks mostly offers information on the sell side of private and public companies but not on the buy side. They could utilize their algorithms and machine learning to help companies get a better valuation of their company. 

It would benefit the company by expanding its client base to both supplier and the customer. Although this may cause a conflict of interest, I believe it would be worth looking into for the future growth of the company.

They would utilize the already existing technologies they have and expand on those including data analytics and machine learning.
