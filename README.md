### Business Activities:

Pitchbooks main solution is to provide the lack of information available for the private markets. Publicly traded companies have an abundance of information available for companies and individuals to access such as daily stock prices, 10K’s, and other public financial disclosures that do not exist for private companies. Pitchbooks “mission is to provide high-quality information and hard-to-find details on the private capital markests, including valuations, cap table information and deal terms, in addition to the most detailed information on private company financings that no one else has” as stated by the founder himself.

Who is the company’s intended customer? Pitchbook main client base is Private equity firms, Venture Capitalists and Investment Banks dealing with Mergers and Acquisitions. These companies are provided with detailed information on Small and Medium size private business as well as large enterprises. 

Pitchbook utilizes its competitive advantage with a database of more than 1.3 million companies. Using this “the firm can quickly discover businesses within its target regions and industry verticals, as well as see funding history, current investors and similar companies.” (1.4)
